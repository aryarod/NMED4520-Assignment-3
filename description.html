        The site is about math and numbers. It is a simple site that has a list of numbers from 1 to 370. The site
        demonstrates
        the use of HTML and CSS. A Chalkboard is used as background and appropriate fonts are used to immitate a
        classroom Chalkboard
        with math content written on it. The site is responsive and can be viewed on any device. Math can be a
        complicated subject however
        the layout of this site is easy to understand and very legible.
